## 4. System Features

### 4.1 User Registration and Login

**Description and Priority**:  
User authentication is essential for allowing personalized experiences and secure booking. **Priority: High**.

**Functional Requirements**:

- **REQ-1**: Users must register with their email address, name, and password.
- **REQ-2**: Users should be able to log in using registered credentials (email and password).
- **REQ-3**: Implement password recovery via email for users who forget their password.
- **REQ-4**: Users can update their profile information (name, email, password).

### 4.2 Booking System

**Description and Priority**:  
Attendees should be able to browse events, select movies, and book tickets through a real-time seat map. **Priority: High**.

**Functional Requirements**:

- **REQ-5**: Attendees can browse a list of upcoming movies and events.
- **REQ-6**: Attendees can select showtimes and view available seats.
- **REQ-7**: Attendees can book tickets and receive a confirmation via email/SMS.
- **REQ-8**: Admins can view and manage bookings for each event.

### 4.3 Payment Gateway Integration

**Description and Priority**:  
Attendees must be able to pay for tickets securely via integrated third-party payment gateways.
**Priority: High**.

**Functional Requirements**:

- **REQ-9**: Attendees can pay for tickets using credit/debit cards, PayPal, or other payment methods.

## 5. Other Nonfunctional Requirements

### 5.1 Performance Requirements

- The system must be capable of handling **10,000 concurrent users** without any degradation in performance, ensuring fast load times and smooth user interactions even during peak usage times, such as when tickets for popular events go on sale.
  
- The platform must maintain an **uptime of 99.99%**, ensuring minimal downtime and service disruptions.

  **How it will be achieved**:
  - **Load Balancing**: Utilize a load balancer (e.g., AWS Elastic Load Balancer) to distribute user traffic across multiple backend servers, helping maintain performance during traffic spikes.
  - **Caching**: Implement caching mechanisms (e.g., Redis, Memcached) to reduce server load by storing frequently accessed data in memory, speeding up response times for common requests.

### 5.2 Security Requirements

- All user data (including passwords and payment details) will be encrypted using **AES-256** encryption.

  **How it will be achieved**:
  - **Data-at-Rest Encryption**: Use AES-256 encryption to securely store sensitive data such as user passwords and payment information in the database. This ensures that any sensitive data is encrypted both in the database and in backup storage.
  - **Encryption Keys Management**: Use a key management service (e.g., AWS KMS, HashiCorp Vault) to securely store and rotate encryption keys, ensuring that access to sensitive data is tightly controlled.

- Implement **2-factor authentication (2FA)** for admin access.

  **How it will be achieved**:
  - **2FA Integration**: Utilize third-party services like Authy, Google Authenticator, or AWS Cognito to provide 2FA for admin accounts. Admins will be required to authenticate with both a password and a second factor, such as an OTP or an authenticator app.

### 5.3 Usability Requirements

- The platform must be easy to use with a responsive design for all devices.

  **How it will be achieved**:
  - **Responsive Web Design**: The front-end will be built using responsive design techniques (e.g., Flexbox, CSS Grid) and frameworks like Bootstrap or Material-UI to ensure the platform is accessible on any device (desktop, tablet, mobile).
  - **Continuous Improvements**: Regular usability testing will be conducted with users to identify pain points in the user journey and continuously improve the interface.

### 5.4 Scalability Requirements

- The system should scale to handle an increasing number of users and events.

  **How it will be achieved**:
  - **Horizontal Scaling**: The application will be designed to scale horizontally by adding more server instances to meet demand. For databases, horizontal scaling can be achieved using sharding (splitting data across multiple database servers) or read replicas to distribute the load.
  - **Cloud-Native Infrastructure**: Leverage cloud platforms (AWS, GCP, Azure) with services that can auto-scale and expand as the number of users or events grows. This ensures seamless scaling of both the application and database components.
  - **Asynchronous Processing**: Offload non-critical tasks such as notifications, reports, or processing large media files to background jobs using a task queue (e.g., AWS SQS, Celery) to keep the system responsive under high load.
