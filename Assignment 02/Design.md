  - Cross-site request forgery (CSRF)
- Regular **security audits** and **penetration testing** to identify potential risks.
- **Compliance with international data protection regulations** (e.g., GDPR, CCPA).
- Secure **API design** with **token-based authentication**.
- **Advanced threat detection** and prevention mechanisms.

---

### 7.5 Reliability
- **Automatic error detection** and logging for proactive issue resolution.
- **Graceful error handling** to ensure smooth user experience even during failures.
- **Circuit breaker pattern** to prevent cascading failures.
- Comprehensive **monitoring** and **alerting systems** to detect and respond to issues in real-time.
- Detailed **performance and error reporting** to track and resolve issues.
- **Automatic rollback** of problematic deployments to ensure minimal service disruption.

---

### 7.6 Compliance
- **GDPR compliance** for user data protection.
- **CCPA data privacy regulations** for California-based users.
- **COPPA guidelines** for content involving minors.
- **Accessibility standards** (WCAG 2.1) for users with disabilities.
- **Transparent data usage policies** to inform users about data handling.
- **User consent management** for data collection and processing.
