# 11. Load Testing Results

Objective: Evaluate the system's ability to handle 10,000 concurrent users under expected conditions.

| Metric                       | Value                      | Notes                                      |
|------------------------------|----------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Concurrent Users         | 10,000                    | Maximum concurrent users during the test. |
| Average Response Time    | 350 ms                    | Well within the acceptable limit (<500 ms).|
| Peak Response Time       | 600 ms                    | Slightly higher during peak load spikes.  |
| Throughput               | 5,000 requests/second      | High throughput maintained consistently.  |
| Error Rate               | 0.1%                      | Occasional failures for edge cases.       |
| CPU Usage                | 70%                       | Optimal usage; no bottlenecks observed.   |
| Memory Usage             | 65%                       | Memory usage remained stable.             |
| Database Queries/Second  | 3,500 queries/second       | Handled efficiently with read replicas.   |

### Observations:
- The system successfully handled the target 10,000 concurrent users without significant performance degradation.
- Average response times were within acceptable limits.
- Minimal error rate observed, likely due to network spikes during peak load.

---

## 2. Stress Testing Results

Objective: Evaluate the system's behavior under extreme conditions beyond expected limits.

| Metric                       | Value                     | Notes                                      |
|------------------------------|---------------------------|--------------------------------------------|
| Concurrent Users         | 25,000                   | Peak load to test system limits.          |
| Average Response Time    | 800 ms                   | Increased significantly beyond 20,000 users. |
| Peak Response Time       | 1,500 ms                 | Response time spiked under heavy load.    |
| Throughput               | 7,500 requests/second    | Maintained until 20,000 users, then dropped. |
| Error Rate               | 5%                       | Errors increased significantly beyond capacity. |
| CPU Usage                | 95%                      | Near saturation, indicating the need for scaling. |
| Memory Usage             | 90%                      | Close to capacity; swap space usage observed. |
| Database Queries/Second  | 6,000 queries/second     | Query handling became a bottleneck.       |

### Observations:
- The system degraded gracefully until 20,000 concurrent users, after which response times and error rates increased.
- Bottlenecks were observed in the database layer, suggesting a need for better sharding or additional replicas.
- CPU and memory resources were nearly saturated, indicating the need for scaling.

## Scenario: Ad Targeting Accuracy and Delivery Compliance

### Description:
This test ensures that the platform delivers ads to the correct audience based on predefined targeting criteria, such as user demographics, location, or preferences. It also validates that the platform provides accurate delivery reports to advertisers.

### Test Script:

```javascript
// Import necessary libraries
const chai = require('chai');
const chaiHttp = require('chai-http');
const server = require('../server'); 
const { expect } = chai;

chai.use(chaiHttp);

describe('Ad Targeting Accuracy and Delivery Compliance', () => {
    it('should deliver ads to users matching the targeting criteria', (done) => {
        const userMock = {
            userId: '12345',
            demographics: { age: 25, location: 'Lucknow', interests: ['movies', 'music'] }
        };

        chai.request(server)
            .post('/api/ads/serve')
            .send(userMock) 
            .end((err, res) => {
                expect(res).to.have.status(200); 
                expect(res.body).to.have.property('ad').that.includes('adId'); 
                expect(res.body.ad).to.have.property('targetingCriteria');
                expect(res.body.ad.targetingCriteria).to.include({ location: 'Lucknow' }); 
                done();
            });
    });

    it('should log ad impressions and provide accurate reporting', (done) => {
        const adId = 'ad123';

        chai.request(server)
            .get(`/api/ads/report/${adId}`)
            .end((err, res) => {
                expect(res).to.have.status(200); 
                expect(res.body).to.have.property('impressions').that.is.a('number'); 
                expect(res.body.impressions).to.be.above(0); 
                done();
            });
    });

    it('should reject ads with invalid targeting parameters', (done) => {
        const invalidAd = {
            adId: 'invalid123',
            targetingCriteria: { age: 'invalidAge', location: 12345 }
        };

        chai.request(server)
            .post('/api/ads/validate')
            .send(invalidAd)
            .end((err, res) => {
                expect(res).to.have.status(400); 
                expect(res.body).to.have.property('error', 'Invalid targeting parameters');
                done();
            });
    });
});
```
