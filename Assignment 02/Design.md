6. **Admin**:  
   - Manages the system by monitoring logs and blocking abusive users.

## **Abuse Cases**:
- **Force Exclusive Contracts**: Imposing exclusivity on theaters.
- **Charge Excessive Convenience Fees**: Imposing high fees on consumers.
- **Manipulate Ticket Availability**: Controlling ticket visibility for profit.
- **Impose Unfair Terms on Small Theaters**: Imposing one-sided conditions on smaller entities.
- **Engage in Predatory Pricing**: Offering tickets at unsustainable prices to eliminate competition.
- **Book Cinema/Show/Event Tickets**: Primary legitimate functionality for users.
- **Create Fake Accounts**: Malicious activity by hackers to exploit the platform.
- **Perform Unauthorized Actions**: Actions by hackers to disrupt the system or exploit vulnerabilities.
- **Data Theft**: Malicious extraction of user data by hackers.
- **Monitor System Logs**: Admin activity to ensure the system's integrity.
- **Block Abusive Users**: Admin functionality to maintain a safe user environment.

## **Relationships**:
1. **Competitor**:  
   - Affected by unethical practices like exclusive contracts, ticket manipulation, and predatory pricing.
2. **Theater**:  
   - Pressured to comply with exclusive contracts and unfair terms.
3. **Consumer**:  
   - Faces negative impacts due to high fees, manipulated ticket availability, and predatory pricing.
4. **Admin**:
