## Negative Reviews

### **Review 1**
**Title:** Never use this app  
**Details:** BookMyShow's service is extremely disappointing. Customers are made to wait for hours in the queue to speak to a representative, only to be told that no changes can be made to the tickets, and refunds are not possible. The customer care team admitted that they don't even have a "reschedule button" for modifying bookings. Such basic features are absent, and it reflects poorly on the company's understanding of customer needs. The overall experience is frustrating and not worth anyone's time.

### **Review 2**
**Title:** I had a very repulsive experience with…  
**Details:** A customer booked tickets for Harsh Gujral's comedy show but faced multiple issues. First, the show timing was changed, causing major inconvenience. Despite requesting a refund on October 2, it has not been processed even after several weeks. The lack of timely refunds and communication has left the customer extremely dissatisfied and unwilling to recommend the platform to others.

### **Review 3**
**Title:** I tried booking 2 tickets for a movie…  
**Details:** The customer attempted to use a Bank of Baroda Debit card offer for booking tickets. However, the payment page did not highlight the offer, preventing them from availing the discount. Frustrated by the false advertising and failure to keep promises, the customer chose to book directly at the theatre instead of using BookMyShow. Such misleading practices undermine customer trust.

### **Review 4**
**Title:** So disappointing  
**Details:** The customer wanted to ensure subtitles were available for a regional movie as their relatives did not understand the language. After a long wait of 30 minutes, customer service falsely claimed that the movie did not have subtitles. On attending the movie alone, the customer discovered subtitles were available. This misinformation caused the relatives to miss the movie. Such negligence from the staff is unacceptable.

### **Review 5**
**Title:** 3rd grade customer service  
**Details:** Despite booking MotoGP tickets months in advance, the customer had not received them even with only 10 days left for the event. The tickets, which included additional delivery charges, were not delivered. Repeated attempts to contact customer service resulted in stereotyped BOT responses and no resolution. For an international event with high ticket prices, the lack of professionalism is appalling.

### **Review 6**
**Title:** Bad experience with BookMyShow  
**Details:** The customer booked 3 movie tickets, and although the amount was deducted from their account, the tickets were not confirmed. Even after 15 days and multiple complaints, the refund has not been issued. Such delays and inefficiencies are unacceptable for a platform claiming to offer seamless ticket booking.

### **Review 7**
**Title:** Trying to book a movie ticket since 2…  
**Details:** The customer faced persistent technical issues with the platform, unable to proceed past the "Buy Tickets" window for two consecutive days. Even after trying multiple devices and browsers, the problem persisted. Frustrated, the customer eventually booked through Cinepolis without any issues, highlighting BookMyShow's poor user experience and reliability.

### **Review 8**
**Title:** Book My Show Have Ultimate Cancellation…  
**Details:** The customer arrived at the theatre for a show scheduled at 4:45 PM, only to find it canceled without prior notification. Shockingly, the cancellation was processed after the showtime, at 5:30 PM. Despite the inconvenience, the platform offered no support or compensation, leaving the customer disappointed and frustrated.

### **Review 9**
**Title:** Abysmal Customer Service  
**Details:** After experiencing a series of issues with broken 3D glasses and an unsatisfactory movie experience, the customer raised a complaint. However, the complaint was closed without resolution, and the customer was not even informed. Attempts to contact customer service yielded no response. The platform's lack of accountability and unprofessional complaint handling is shocking.

### **Review 10**
**Title:** Do not use this company…  
**Details:** Booked tickets for a high-profile football match, but the ticket collection process was poorly managed. Despite receiving instructions to collect tickets 20 minutes before the match, the ticket office had closed hours earlier. This mismanagement caused the tickets to become unusable, and the company refused to issue a refund. Such inefficiencies are unacceptable for any ticketing platform.

### **Review 11**
**Title:** Cheating at the time of ticket booking  
**Details:** The customer noticed inconsistent pricing on the platform. The seat price displayed as ₹320 changed to ₹340 on the payment page. When questioned, customer service explained it as dynamic pricing. However, the booking page continued to show the lower price, which the customer felt was deliberate misrepresentation.

### **Review 12**
**Title:** Worst experience with BookMyShow app  
**Details:** After years of using the platform, the customer noted a steady decline in service quality. The platform now imposes exorbitant convenience charges for each ticket, making it unaffordable for regular users. Such practices make the service less appealing despite its earlier reliability.  
**Date of Experience:** May 22, 2020

### **Review 13**
**Title:** Very bad service  
**Details:** When using a buy-one-get-one-free offer, bookings frequently fail, and refunds take 4–7 days to process. This causes users to lose out on offers entirely. Even for premium "superstar users," customer support is unresponsive, further aggravating the issue.  
**Date of Experience:** June 27, 2024

### **Review 14**
**Title:** The OFFERS they show on BookMyShow is…  
**Details:** Offers advertised by BookMyShow, such as ₹100 off on two tickets, are often unavailable at checkout. Customers are forced to pay the full amount, including GST, despite following all steps. Such deceptive practices undermine user confidence.
